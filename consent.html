            <p><span class="lead">General information</span>. This study investigates the effects of performance judgements such as confidence on how people make subsequent decisions and learn.
                By further understanding the processes underlying decision making and learning we aim to add to the growing knowledge of human behaviour and cognition.</p>
            <p> We appreciate your interest in participating in this online survey. You have been invited to take part in this research because you have indicated that
                you might be interested in participating, and you are currently (i) aged 18-40, (ii) fluent English speaking, (iii) have normal or corrected-to- normal vision, (iv) neurologically healthy,
                and (v) not on any medication with psychoactive effects. Please read through these terms before agreeing to participate by ticking the ‘yes’ box below. You may ask any questions before taking
                part by contacting the researcher (contact us). </p>
            <p> We (the Attention and Cognitive Control Lab at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford) are investigating how performance judgements (e.g. confidence levels)
                are used in the process of decision making. A computer-based task involving simple discrimination or categorization judgments will be used. During the computer-based experiment, you will
                be presented with visual and/or auditory stimuli, and will then be asked to make judgments about them or about your performance in the task, as per the instructions given before the task.
                You may also be asked to answer some questions relevant to the task. The study will take approximately 1 hour. </p>
